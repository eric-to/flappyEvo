    <h2>Neural Networks & Neuroevolution</h2>

      <p>
        Flappy Bird was a popular game originally created by indie game developer Dong Nguyen.
        Its a simple game with a tap-to-jump mechanic, which is harder to master than it may
        appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, one of the coolest advancements in the game industry has been artificial intelligence
        that dynamically learns with or without input from the environment. For a game such as Flappy Bird,
        two common techniques have been used to teach the AI how to play: reinforcement learning (has been around
        longer) and neuroevolution, which at its core, is an implementation of real-life genetic evolution and
        mutation.
      </p>
      <p>
        General summary of how the AI learns how to play: On the first generation of the "game", there are several
        AI, which are actually all individual neural networks (like having many birds, each having one brain). When
        a game ends, or all the birds of one generation have died or lost the game, the longest surviving birds or
        fittest birds (like in Darwinism) are used to create a genetic crossover / next generation. Each bird in the
        new generation is a very slightly modified neural network / mutated to allow for continued learning.
